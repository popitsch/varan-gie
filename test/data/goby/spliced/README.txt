This aligment contains four reads that map to the Kevin's simulated genome (see kevin-synth directory).
The first two reads match in the forward strand, the last two reads in the reverse strand.
The first read fragment matches at position 10, for 20 bases.
The second read fragment matches at position 70 for 30 bases. The last two reads represent the same alignment on the
reverse strand. The Goby IGV code should detect the splice links and render the fragments as part of the
same alignments.
