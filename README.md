# VARAN-GIE: An IGV extension for the annotation of genomic intervals. 
	
## Introduction
	
VARAN [(*)](#about) is a *branch* of [Broad's popular Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/).
It *extends* IGV by **adding functionality to create, edit and annotate sets of genomic intervals**.
By this, VARAN supports an integrative approach to viewing and annotating large genomic data sets.

VARAN is now published in [Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty723).

## Application Scenarios

- Manual curation of genomic annotations, e.g., gene lists, CNV or SV calls, novel transcripts
- Collaborative merging and curation of multiple BED files
- De-novo authoring of multi-layered interval sets
and many more...

## Installation

1. Download and unzip the [release ZIP file](https://github.com/popitsch/varan-gie/releases/)
2. Start VARAN-GIE with the respective shell script or by directly running the (executable) JAR file
