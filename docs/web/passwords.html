<h2>
    Overview</h2>

<p>When a user enters a password-protected URL, IGV prompts for a user name and password. If the username/password
    combination is incorrect, IGV&nbsp;will continue to ask the user to authenticate until the combination is entered
    correctly or the user clicks&nbsp;<em>Cancel</em>.</p>

<h2>Setting up password protection on an Apache server</h2>

<p>There are many ways to set up a password-protected site.&nbsp; The following describes one method of handling this on
    an Apache server using an ".htaccess" file.</p>


<p>Setting up a
    password requires:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        an Access File
    </li>
    <li>
        a Password File
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The Access File (.htaccess) is located in the restricted directory.&nbsp; It should contain the following
    information:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">AuthUserFile /home/[path]/.
    <wbr>
    htpasswd<br/>
    AuthName &quot;Private IGV Folder&quot;<br/>
    AuthType Basic<br/>
    Require valid-user</wbr></p>

<p>The first line should contain the path to the Password File.</p>

<p>The Password File (.htpasswd) should be placed in a directory that is accessible <em>internally</em>, not through the
    web. This is can be the home directory, but it must be a location that is not externally visible.&nbsp; An example
    password file might look like this:</p>

<p class="rteindent1">user1:kJs1GPxWtLet2</p>

<p>The file contains the usernames and passwords for all authenticated users, with one user per line. In the example
    line,&nbsp; the username is &quot;user1&quot; and the password is &quot;kJx1GPxWtLet2,&quot;&nbsp;which is an
    encrypted password representing the human-readable word, &quot;password.&quot;</p>

<p>To make the authentication lines, users can contact IT&nbsp;staff or use one of several websites that help generate
    them.&nbsp; The one used for this line was <a href="http://www.kxs.net/support/htaccess_pw.html" target="_blank">http://www.kxs.net/support/
        <wbr>
        htaccess_pw.html</wbr></a>. This website provides a string that can be used in the .htpasswd file.
</p>

<p>To test use a web browser to access a file in &nbsp;the password-protected directory URL. &nbsp; You should be
    prompted for a username and password.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following files are password protected using the procedure described above.  Try loading into IGV using <em>File&gt;Load from URL</em>:.
You will be prompoted for a username and password,  enter  "guest" for username and "password" for password.</p>
